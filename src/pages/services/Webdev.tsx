              The first phase involves gathering client briefs and inputs for
              the project. Then based on that information we conduct research on
              the target audience, competition, and market trends to gain an
              understanding of the client's needs and preferences. As a result,
              a plan is created outlining the project scope, identifying the
              target audience, and creating a site map.

            <div className='text-[12px] font-light'>
              This is where the magic happens, this is where we show why we are
              different. This phase involves creating the design concepts,
              wireframes, and prototypes based on the planning phase. We share
              design mockups with the client once they are ready and start an
              iteration process where we get feedback on minor details until the
              final design is approved.

              The website development stage involves the actual creation of the
              website based on the approved design. Front-end development refers
              to the parts that are visible to the user, such as the layout,
              design, and user interface. Back-end development for creating a
              user-friendly CMS system and connecting the front-end content,
              server-side logic, and integrations with third-party systems.

              necessary to ensure that it continues to function properly and
